Wallstreetbets is a subreddit where people discuss anything related to the stock market with an enfaces on high-risk trades. People share their portfolios, predictions, gains, and losses. The emphasis on wallstreetbets is mainly due to its role in the sudden price change of Game Stop stock (GME). Earlier this year, active users in r/wallstreetbets performed a coordinated purchase of undervalued stocks [2,4,6]. Game Stop stock (GME) received a particular interest among these Reddit users, which caused its stock price to skyrocket in less than a couple of days.

At the beginning of the year, when the price of GME reached its peak, there were a lot of questions surrounding wallstreetbets. Many questioned the legality of the users' tactics, some wondered if the internet would change the stock market's operation, and others were curious
