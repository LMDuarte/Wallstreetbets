# Introduction

In recent years, social media has continued to show the transformative and destructive power it has. Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit have allowed people to unionize and impact major institutions. From its effects on politics, public health, and the stock market, social media platforms have shown to be powerful “tools”.

Among all these “tools” Reddit differs with their enfaces in community. Their subreddit feature allows people to collaborate with others in very specific ways. There is a common belief that you could find a subreddit for any kind of community. For this particular analysis, the community or subreddit of interest is r/wallstreetbets.

Wallstreetbets is a subreddit where people discuss anything related to the stock market with an enfaces on high-risk trades. People share their portfolios, predictions, gains, and losses. The emphasis on wallstreetbets is mainly due to its role in the sudden price change of Game Stop stock (GME). Earlier this year, active users in r/wallstreetbets performed a coordinated purchase of undervalued stocks [2,4,6]. Game Stop stock (GME) received a particular interest among these Reddit users, which caused its stock price to skyrocket in less than a couple of days.

At the beginning of the year, when the price of GME reached its peak, there were a lot of questions surrounding wallstreetbets. Many questioned the legality of the users' tactics, some wondered if the internet would change the stock market's operation, and others were curious about the individuals posting on wallstreetbets. For this analysis, I would attempt to clarify the events surrounding the spike in price. I will explore the sentiment and use of language of reddit users, as well as the effect social media sentiment has on the price of Game Stop stock.

# Methods
## Variables

### Game Stop
Game Stop is a Delaware corporation established in 1996 specializing in entertainment products such as video games or video game merchandise. According to their 2020 annual report, they have 4,816 Game Stop stores across the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. They have additional stores, 73, operating under the name Zing Pop for international markets and ThinkGeek for the United States [3].

Game Stop as a company has been on the decline for a few years. Their net sales have decreased from $8,285.3 million in 2018 to $5,089 million in 2020. They have also reported a net loss of 215.3 million dollars as of 2020 [3]. However, despite their decline in sales, some customers may still have some fondness for the company. Perhaps this fondness could have been why subreddit users targeted Game Stop stock.

### Wallstreetbets
The wallstreetbets subreddit was created on January 31st, 2012, and currently has 11.3 million users. According to the wallstreetbets moderators," [the subreddit] is a community for making money and being amused while doing it [7]." Members of this community are traders who implement a risky strategy based on little evidence. Hence their approach resembles more gambling than traditional investment. It could be said that the events surrounding GME started mainly as another form of speculative gambling. However, the organization and targeting by a large portion of the community may have resulted in the spike.

### Sentiment Analysis
Public sentiment has been shown to affect the price of cryptocurrency; therefore, it stands to reason that the same could be possible with stock prices [9]. Using multiple analysis methods such as VADER, afinn, and bing lexicon, we analyzed the sentiment expressed by Reddit users across time.

VADER (Valance Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule base tool designed to analyze text posted on social media. In contrast to other methods VADER is design to recognize language commonly used in social media as well as analyze the whole post at once. VADER is attuned to the intensity often found in social media, by recognizing emoticons, abbreviations, and slang. This tool also considers the placements of words in sentences and the degree in which it modifies a sentence. A sentence such as "the service is extremely good" and "the service is good" would receive a different positive score based on the words modifying the sentence’s intensity. After performing the analysis each posts receives a compound score between -1 and 1 [5].

Additionally to VADER, I utilize the bing & afinn lexicons. The "bing" lexicon labels words as either positive or negative. Bing can be helpful to get a broad picture of the overall vocabulary used by Reddit users. However, it is not suited to graph sentiment across time, and a second 4
lexicon, afinn, was needed to get a more in-depth look into the average sentiment expressed between 2019 and 2021. With the afinn lexicon assigning a score between -5 to +5 to words used in the posts it was possible to get a more in depth look into the average sentiment expressed by members of wallstreetbets.

## Data Collection

### Posts
For this analysis, I needed to find a method that would allow me to extract Reddit data from a specific window of time. Common data extraction methods, both in R and python, only collected the most recent posts under a subreddit. It used to be possible to extract Reddit data through python using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper). However, recent changes made by Reddit have disrupted PRAW's ability to extract specific data. A solution to PRAW's limitation came from pushift.io Reddit API [1]. Pushift.io was designed and created by the r/datasets subreddit to enhance search capabilities for Reddit's posts and comments.

Using upshift.io, I extracted posts from r/walstreetbets mentioning GME between January 2019 and January 31st, 2020. In that timeframe, there was a total of 73,786 posts mentioning GME. In 2019 there were 105 posts, 2020 had 1,274 posts, and January 2021 had 73,786 posts. There was a large amount of data, and the code could only extract around 1,000 posts; therefore, I needed to run the code 22 times.

### Stock Data
In addition to Reddit posts, I needed to extract the price of Game Stop stock from January 2019 to January 2020. Using R, I extracted and visualized the stock price across time. The visualization of the stock price will serve to contextualize the rest of the analysis.

# Results

## Scale
When looking at the data I have decided to separate it based on the year. Due to the drastic increase in price that GME saw at the beginning of 2021, any visualization or analysis would not accurately reflect the events of 2019 and 2020, if it also included data from January 2021.

## Price
Looking at the price of Game Stop stock by year, we can see a steady decline in price, followed by dramatic increase at the beginning of 2021. At the beginning of 2019 the Game Stop stock price was valued at $15.24, however it saw a steady decrease culminating in a price of $5.88. The price then saw an organic growth during the year resulting in a price of $18.84. However, on January 29th 2021, the stock price for game stop saw a sudden spike resulting in a stock price of $325.00.

## GME Mentions
Game Stop stock has been a topic of conversation in the subreddit r/wallstreetbets all the way back to 2019. However, the number of mentions in 2019 to 2020 have been minimal compared to the number of mentions in 2021. Back in 2019 the highest number of monthly posts discussing “GME” were around 20, it is still notable that people had some interest in the status of GME back then. It is not until the end of 2020 that we see an increase in GME mentions. On November 2020 there were a total of 573 posts mentioning GME. Later on we see a dramatic increase at the beginning of 2021. In total there were 73,786 posts mentioning GME on January 2021. The majority of these comments were posted on January 28th (a day before the price spike) with 22,502 posts.

## Sentiment Analysis
For the sentiment analysis I utilize three different tools; VADER, Bing lexicon, and Afinn lexicon. Both the afinn lexicon and VADER were used to graph the users sentiment towards GME across time. While the Bing lexicon allowed me to separate the most negative and positive words used by the commentors.

### Top Woeds
When looking at the users vocabulary my goal was to identify if the way users spoke about GME changed across the years. However, what my visualization ends up showcasing is the users general vocabulary. I do want to be upfront and explain that the language used by the commentors is fairly inappropriate. However, I believe it should be mention and included in this report, since it can be used to understand the kind of people discussing GME. In 2019 the vocabulary was fairly concentrated on terms related to the stock price. Words like “death” and “fail” are used by the commentors to describe the status of GME at the time. Moving up to 2020 we see that the top negative words used are “retards” and “fucking”, both immature and aggressive language. The type of language used does not change for 2021. The data shows that the top two words used in January of 2021 is “fucking” and “fuck”. Instead of reflecting their opinion towards GME it showcases the juvenile and carefree attitude of the users.

### Sentiment over time
Using VADER and the afinn lexicon I was able to graph users’ sentiment towards GME across the years. Performing the analysis with VADER shows us that from 2019 to the end of 2020 the average sentiment towards GME was fairly positive. To put things into context , VADER assigns a score between -1 to 1, and our data shows that between 2019 and the end of 2020 the scores ranged from -0.056 to 0.712. Another thing to note is the two spikes that occurred on October 2019 (0.712000000) and August 2020 (0.245909091). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69866550/145123984-bd0ef4cb-2d89-46c4-b28c-1ce9ca512f77.png)

```markdown

```
Despite the positive tone found in the comments before 2021, the comments from January 2021 display a different sentiment. When looking at the average sentiment scores you can see that they are barely positive. The posts have a more neutral sentiment with their scores ranging from -0.026 to 0.019.

Figure 8: VADER sentiment January 2021
```
I utilized the Afinn lexicon and VADER as a form of redundancy. When measuring the data from 2019 and 2020 using the Afinn lexicon, we can see similar patterns as the sentiment displayed with VADER. The data is mostly positive, with some negative spikes. The Afinn lexicon assigns a score between -5 and 5, and the 2019 and 2020 data has scores ranging from -1.85  to 2.00. We see a score of 2.00 in multiple dates; April 2019, October 2019, July 2020 & August 2020. In contrast, we see a score of -1.85 on September 2019.

```markdown

```
Using the Afinn lexicon, it is apparent that the sentiment from January 2021 is neutral. Compared to the 2019 and 2020 data, the sentiment displayed at the beginning of 2021 has an average score of 0.002. The data shows a positive spike on January 9th 2021 with a score of 1.067 and a negative spike on January 28th 2021 with a score of -0.225.

# Discussion
## Price and Mentions
When looking at the number of mentions and the price of GME, we can see that the two mirror each other. When graphing the two side by side, we see that both the price and mentions increase at a similar rate. As soon as we graph the 2020 data, we start to observe similar spikes between the two graphs. Both the price of GME and the number of mentions in r/wallstreetbets see a spike after August 2020. Now, the most important comparison comes when looking at the data from January 2021. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69866550/145124550-1067bd5c-031d-4a56-a46a-3946366bf674.png)

```markdown
Figure 11: Number of posts & Stock Price: before the spike
```
The argument could be made that the two graphs have similar patterns due to the r/wallstreetbets users discussing the current state of GME. However, the data shows the spike in posts discussing GME occurring on January 28th, 2021, while the spike in price occurred a day after on the 29th. This led me to infer that the number of posts discussing a specific stock could indicate a change in the stock price. Further research needs to be done to understand if this is an isolated incident.

### Personality of Users
Reddit users have a reputation for being juvenile and aggressive; the data collected in this study backs this notion. When looking at the vocabulary used by the members of r/wallstreetbets, we can see that they show unprofessional and aggressive behavior. They call themselves "retards” as an ironic term and use profanity in their posts. The use of language highlights a lack of professionalism. More passion and aggressiveness are going into their decisions to invest in the stock rather than strategy. A comment reads, "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE F*CK I'M DOING BUT I NEED ALL OF YOU TO HOP ON THIS GME… ROCKET WITH ME." Regardless of their juvenile behavior, there is no question their actions and passion had real consequences. There is a level of concern that people with such aggressive attitudes manage to cost short sellers $19.75 billion [8]. 

A different interpretation of the vocabulary choice of these individuals is that we are observing an unfiltered community. The members of r/wallstreetbets do not have any responsibility to mince their words. There is no expectation that they would behave or communicate with any form of professionalism since they are not writing in a professional forum. They are adults who communicate as they please. However, I will still stand with my position that their choice of language does speak to their character. 

Lastly, it should also be mentioned that the choice of words could come from a place of frustration. Buying and holding GME stock was also a form of rebellion in its own right. Users expressed frustration with the tactics that other more affluent traders can take part in. Another post reads, "We must HOLD AMC AND GME OUT OF PURE SPITE FOR …[the]… RICH" Users are definitively juvenile; however, at the same time, they are adults frustrated with the current economic system. A user says, "Wallstreet inside video tells you how Hedge Fund managers …are manipulating the market … and all this to steal from the US".

### Sentiment Over Time
A purpose of this analysis was to explore the connection between sentiment and the price of GME over time. This was attempted by utilizing VADER and the afinn lexicon. After performing the sentiment analysis and visualizing the sentiment over time, I couldn't identify any overly apparent trend in the data. However, there were still some patterns that needed to be addressed. 

One of the most perplexing results from this sentiment analysis was the apathy being expressed in the subreddit. The average sentiment in January of 2021 calculated with the afinn lexicon was 0.002 out of a potential negative or positive five. Similarly, with VADER, the average sentiment was 0.011 out of a potential positive or negative one. Both methods resulted in an average neutral sentiment when it would be expected to see the excitement over the sudden price change. It could be said that the methods implemented to perform the analysis result in an overall neutral sentiment. However, when looking at the 2020 and 2019 data, positive and negative sentiment is still being captured with these methods. Using the afinn lexicon, we see multiple months in which the average sentiment reached a two out of five. Similarly, when looking at the sentiment analysis performed with VADER, we see a spike where the sentiment is 0.712 out of a possible positive and negative one.  

Although initially, it may seem strange that the average sentiment in January of 2021 is overall neutral, the reality is that users were expressing themselves in both positive and negative ways. Graphing the sentiment of each post, we can see that there is an apparent equal number of positive and negative posts, canceling each other out. The spike in price resulted in strong emotions from people against or in favor of GME. A post with a VADER score of (-0.973) reads, "So Today I got f**ed from my Short position on GME. Actual Realized loss is -$19,000 for fees and sh*t not taken out yet". In contrast, another post with a VADER score of (0.981) reads, "GME TO THE MOON!!!! WE ARE STRONGER THAN THEY THINK!! DIAMOND HAND." Additionally, the methods implemented in this analysis were incapable of measuring aggressive support towards GME, skewing the data towards a more negative average. For example, a post supporting GME that still received a VADER score of (-0.983) reads, "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE F**K I'M DOING BUT I NEED ALL OF YOU TO HOP ON THIS GME … ROCKET WITH ME…"

### Limitations VADER
Despite VADER having the benefit of being designed specifically to analyze sentiment shared in social media, it still had limitations. The tool takes complete sentences and considers the context when performing the analysis. Due to this approach and the large amount of data collected for this analysis, it took a considerable amount of time to complete the sentiment analysis. The data needed to be divided into parts and analyzed separately; this wasn't the case for this report's other methods. Although it is specifically designed for social media, different approaches deliver similar results. However, the ability to grade entire posts is exclusive to VADER, and it allows for a more in-depth analysis of the data. We can identify specific examples and come to conclusions based on posts and not language. VADER is still a valuable tool that should be implemented in the future. 

### Closing
The data collected for this analysis can serve as an insight into the sudden rise in price for the Game Stop stock. The data consists of the stock price change, the number of posts mentioning the stock, the language being used when discussing the stock, and the sentiment of the posts mentioning the stock. 

Although the initial purpose of the sentiment analysis was to identify any pattern between sentiment and stock price, the analysis served better to understand the emotional state of the Reddit users. By looking at the language being used by members of wallstreetbets, we can infer that they are a group of aggressive, passionate, but juvenile individuals. Based on the sentiment analysis, it is visible that there were people both in favor and against the GME movement at the beginning of the year. 

Finally, one of the potential indicators for stock price change could be the number of times a stock is mentioned on wallstreetbets. Further research is needed to establish a connection between the number of posts and the price change. For this specific example, there was a sudden spike in comments a day before the spike in price. Regardless of whether the comments were positive or negative, the emphasis on a single stock could indicate a change in the stock price. Others should apply a similar methodology implemented in this analysis to different stocks discussed in r/wallstreetbets.
